# FatigueGuard
A bukkit plugin to add mining fatigue to certain world guard regions.

This plugin depends on world guard.

## How it works
When you walk into a region you get mining fatigue.  
When you walk out of the region it gets removed.  
Simple as that.

This plugin also supports the **\_\_global\_\_** region.

## Commands
`/fg fatigue <level>` sets the mining fatigue level starting with 0.  
`/fg add <world> <region>` adds a region of a specific world to the list of fatigue regions.  
`/fg remove <world> <region>` removes a region of a specific world from the list of fatigue regions.
